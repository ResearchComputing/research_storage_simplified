# RC Quick Byte: Research Storage Simplified
Course materials for the Research Storage Simplified RC Quick Byte

Want to learn the best practices for storing data on RC systems? This RC Quick Byte* is intended to assist users in determining the best place to store their data based on considerations of data integrity, performance, and ease of sharing. In this workshop, we’ll discuss the different filesystems available to CURC users, how to select the best filesystem for your needs, and how to optimize the storage performance of your jobs. You can expect to leave this training with an understanding of the differences between various CURC filesystems, as well as when to use which filesystem.
This session will be fully remote. The instructor will be available after the session to answer any questions. While not required, a CURC account and a basic familiarity with the Linux terminal will help in understanding the materials covered. To obtain an account, CU Boulder users should watch our Creating an Account video. RMACC members should refer to our RMACC Access to Alpine page.
